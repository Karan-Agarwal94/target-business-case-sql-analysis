# Delivery Performance Analysis – Key Insights

### Overall Delivery Timelines
- Delivery times range from 1 day at the lower end to over 200 days in extreme cases,
demonstrating substantial variability and highlighting potential logistics-related
bottlenecks.

### Delivery Estimate Accuracy
- Delivery estimate shows a wide misalignment between estimated and actual delivery times.
- Some deliveries arrived 147 days earlier than estimated (over-pessimistic forecasting), while others were 188 days later than estimated (severe delays).
- The largest variances cluster at both extremes, indicating systemic issues with delivery time predictions.
- This suggests the company either used poor estimation algorithms or faced major logistical disruptions.

### Regional Delivery Performance
- There is a significant geographic disparities in delivery performance across all states.
- The northern/remote states (RR, AP, AM) suffer from the longest average delivery times, exceeding 26 days, likely due to logistical challenges.
- In contrast, the southeastern economic hubs (SP, MG, PR) enjoy the fastest delivery averages, with Sao Paulo leading at just 8.7 days.
- The results show a clear correlation between delivery speed and regional development or infrastructure, with a dramatic 20-day gap between the best and worst-performing states.

### Business Implications
- Large delivery-time variance exposes logistics inconsistency and customer
  experience risk.
- Inaccurate delivery estimates indicate a need for data-driven recalibration.
- Remote regions require targeted logistics solutions to reduce persistent delays.
- High-performance regions demonstrate the impact of infrastructure and scale.
