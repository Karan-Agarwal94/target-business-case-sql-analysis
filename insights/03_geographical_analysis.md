## Customer Concentration
- Customer distribution is highly skewed across states.
- A small number of states like SP, RJ, MG contribute a disproportionately large share
  of the total customer base whereas some states like AC, AP, AM, RR contribute insignificant number of total customers.

## Order Distribution
- Order volume closely mirrors customer concentration, indicating
  strong regional dependency in business performance.
- Top-performing states consistently generate the highest order counts.

## Regional Seasonality
- Month-on-month analysis shows that high-performing states maintain
  steady order volumes across most months.
- Lower-volume states exhibit higher volatility and inconsistent demand.

## Business Implications
- Core states should remain the primary focus for logistics optimization
  and customer retention efforts.
- States with low customer and order volumes represent potential growth areas.
  By increasing marketing efforts and improving delivery availability in these
  regions, the business could expand its customer base and order volume.
