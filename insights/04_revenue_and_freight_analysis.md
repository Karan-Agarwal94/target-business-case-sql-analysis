# Revenue & Freight Analysis – Key Insights

### Revenue Distribution
- The state of SP (Sao Paulo) generates the highest total revenue at over R$5.2 million, despite having one of the lowest average item prices (R$109.65).
- Smaller states like PB (Paraiba) and AL (Alagoas) show high average item prices (R$191.48 and R$180.89) but contribute far less to total revenue.
- This suggests sales volume in populous states drives overall revenue, while higher-priced items are more common in less populous states.

### Pricing Characteristics
- Larger states (SP, RJ, MG) bear the highest total freight costs due to order volume, but enjoy lower average freight rates per item (R$15–21).
- In contrast, smaller and more remote states like RR, PB, and AC face significantly higher average freight costs (R$40+), despite contributing far less to total freight spend.
- This indicates a logistics cost disparity, where remote regions pay a premium per delivery compared to high-volume urban centers.


### Freight Cost Patterns
- Lower-revenue, often more remote states (like RR, MA, RO) bear the highest freight cost ratios — over 24–28% of revenue spent on shipping.
- In contrast, high-revenue states like SP, RJ, and MG have much lower freight percentages (13–17%), benefiting from economies of scale and better logistics infrastructure.
- This highlights a logistical inequity where smaller regions face disproportionately higher shipping costs relative to sales value.

### Business Implications
- High-revenue states like SP, RJ, and MG should be prioritized for retention
  and operational efficiency, as they generate the bulk of revenue at lower
  relative freight costs.
- Remote and low-volume states face disproportionately high freight-to-revenue
  ratios, indicating a need for logistics optimization to improve profitability.
- States with high average item prices but low sales volume present opportunities
  for targeted marketing to increase order frequency without sacrificing margins.
- Regional differences in freight efficiency should be considered in pricing,
  expansion, and logistics planning decisions.
