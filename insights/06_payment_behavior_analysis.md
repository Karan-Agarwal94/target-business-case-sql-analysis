# Payment Behavior Analysis – Key Insights

### Payment Method Preferences
- Payment by credit card was overwhelmingly preferred, accounting for over 76,500 orders.
- UPI emerged as a distant second, used for nearly 20,000 orders.
- Vouchers and debit cards were used sparingly, while only 3 orders had an undefined payment method.

### Payment Trends Over Time
- Month-on-month analysis indicates stable payment preferences, with no major
  shifts in dominant payment methods.
- This suggests strong customer familiarity and trust in existing payment modes.

### Installment Usage
- The vast majority of orders (49,060) were paid in a single installment.
- The number of orders consistently decreases as the number of installments increases from 2 to 9, indicating most customers prefer fewer, larger payments.
- However, there are notable spikes at 8 and especially 10 installments, suggesting specific, popular installment plans offered at those intervals.
- Orders with more than 10 installments are very rare.

### Business Implications
- Credit cards should remain the primary focus for payment optimization, as they
  drive the majority of transactions and represent the most trusted payment mode.
- UPI’s strong secondary adoption indicates an opportunity to further grow its
  usage through targeted incentives such as cashback or faster checkout flows.
- The dominance of single and short-term installments suggests customers prefer
  simpler payment structures, reducing the need for complex long-term EMI offerings.
- Noticeable spikes at specific installment counts (8 and 10) highlight the impact
  of predefined EMI plans, which can be strategically promoted to increase
  affordability without broadly extending credit risk.
